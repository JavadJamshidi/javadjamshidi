# Hi, I'm Javad Jamshidi 👋
.NET Developer & professional C# dreamer (and part-time nap champion 😴)

---

## About Me
Born in 1998 in Qom, Iran. Started coding at 13 with HTML, but true love came with C# — sharp, elegant, and just like my dreams. I build cool stuff with ASP.NET Core, WPF, and .NET MAUI... all while perfecting the art of power napping.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** C# (the sharpest tool in my kit)
- **Frameworks:** ASP.NET Core, WPF, Windows Forms, .NET MAUI, ...
- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - Visual Studio (my coding dojo)
  - JetBrains Rider (fast & furious IDE)
  - Git + GitHub (not because I love them... but because I have to 😬)  
  - Docker (packing apps like a pro)  
  - Postman (the classic API buddy)
  - HTTPie (when I feel like being a terminal ninja 🥷)
  - Swagger / Swashbuckle (because pretty APIs matter)
  - .NET CLI (when I wanna feel cool in terminal)
  - Fiddler (for catching those sneaky requests)
  - NuGet (because writing everything from scratch is overrated)

## 🎯 Currently Learning  
- Blazor (making the web *blazingly* fast — fingers crossed!)  
- ML.NET (because why not sprinkle some machine learning magic on my code?)
